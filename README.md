# Portfolio---Value-Investments
A portfolio constructor for value investments

The goal of this project is to provide a strategy for value investments and will be looking at the S&P500 in particular. The structure of the workbook will process the three fundamental stages in the creation of the portfolio:
- Portfolio construction based on fundamental analysis
- Portfolio optimisation using Monte Carlo simulation
- Risk management using VaR and CVaR

The repository contains the following documents:
- A folder containing datasets needed to run the script. The data folder contains 10 files
- A jupyter notebook called Portfolio Construction & Optimisation
- A PDF report that contains a breakdown of the script. All crucial information about the investment strategy can be accessed from the report

## Prerequisites
- You can get the latest version of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). The version used in this project was Python 3.9.7.
- All dependencies are installed at the beginning of the workbook.

## Getting Started
To clone this repository, run the following:
```python
git clone https://github.com/saad-ibrahim/Portfolio---Value-Investments
```

### Running the program
You may find that when you run the script your ouput in the portfolio optimisation section will not be the same as those presented here. This is not a mistake, the script incorporates Monte Carlo simulation which will generate different values every time it is ran.
